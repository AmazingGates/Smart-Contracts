I promise to never hard code my private key in my code, and to always use a secure method to store
and retrieve my private key, such as using a hardware wallet or a secure key management service.

I will always encrypt my private key, and I will never store it in a plain text file.

I will never share my private key with anyone, and I will always keep it safe and secure.
