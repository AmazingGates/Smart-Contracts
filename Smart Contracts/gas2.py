# In this section we will be going over the concept of Block Rewards & EIP-1559.

# The Main takeaway from this section is that the Block Reward is the incentive for miners to mine blocks and
# secure the network. It is the reward that miners receive for successfully mining a block and adding it to the
#blockchain. The Block Reward is made up of two parts: the Block Subsidy and the Transaction Fees. The Block
#Subsidy is the fixed amount of cryptocurrency that is awarded to the miner for successfully mining a block.

# The more people that use the network, the more transactions are made, and the more transaction fees are paid 
#to the miners. This is why it is important to have a healthy and active network, as it ensures that miners
#are incentivized to continue mining and securing the network. The Block Reward is what keeps the network
#secure and functioning properly.

# The more people that use a chain, the more expensive it is to send a transaction. This is because the 
#miners will mine the chains with the highest incentives.

# Currently in Ethereum, according to EIP-1559, every transaction on the etheruem network has a base fee
#that is burned, and a priority fee that is paid to the miner. The base fee is the minimum amount of gas
#we need to set to include our transaction in the mining process. 

# The base fee is priced in gwei, which is a denomination of ether. 1 ether = 1,000,000,000 gwei. The base fee
#is burned, meaning it is removed from circulation and cannot be used again. 

# The Max Priority Fee is the amount of gas we are willing to pay to the miner plus the Max Tip.

# Currently in Ethereum, the base fee ends up getting burnt, and the priority fee is paid to the miner.

# EIP-1559 is considered a Type 2 transaction, which means that it is a transaction that has a base fee and a
#priority fee.

# Every Blockchain is going to have a different fee burning and gas and fee process, but the default base is
#going to be set at 0.00000004 GWEI. Also, This is the amount that ends up getting burnt during the 
#transaction process.

# Also, the more people making transactions and the more Ethereum being mined means the more base 
#Ethereum is burned.

# The Base Fee gets Programmatically and Algorithimatically adjusted to try and target for all the Blocks
#to be 50% Full, if they're more than 50% Full, the Base Fee automatically goes up, and if they're less
#than 50% Full they automatically go down.

# These are the Basics of how these Transactions work.
