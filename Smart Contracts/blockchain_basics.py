# This is where we start our Blaockchain Basics.

# Smart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a 
#centralized or third party intemediary.

# Removes centralized forces and counterparty risk.

# This is one of the main differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

# Technically Bitcoin does have Smart Contrcats, but it is intentionally "turning incomplete".

# This is done by Bitcoin developers purposely who viewed Bitcoin as a store of value.

# Ethereum developers viewed Ethereum both as a store of value, and a utility to facilitate these 
#decentralized agreements.

# Bitcoins are intentionally walled off.

# This is what's known as the "Oracle Problem".

# Bitcoin is a deterministic system, and it is deterministic on purpose.

# Everything that happens with them happens in their own world.

# 1. What Is An Oracle?
# An oracle is a third party data source that provides information to smart contracts.

# However, if we want our applications to stay truly decentralized, we can't work with a single oracle. So
#we need a decentralized oracle network, similar to a decentralized blockchain network. Our oncahin logic
#will be decentralized, but we also need our offchain data to be decentralized.

# Combing the two is gives rise to what is known as "Hybrid Smart Contracts". On-chain + off-chain
#agreements.

# Most of the biggest protocals in DeFi are hybrid smart contracts, or interact with hybrid smart contracts.

# This is where the protocal Chainlink comes into play.

# It is a modular decentralized oracle network that provides off-chain data to on-chain smart contracts.

# Although we use the term Smart Contract, this term is interchangeable with the term Hybrid Smart Contract.

# Also note that when we say Hybrid Smart Contract we are referring to Smart Contracts that have some type
#of off-chain component.

# Since Ethereums release, many other blockchains have been released that are also capable of running 
#smart contracts, such as Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and Cardano.

# For the majority of the course we will be using the Ethereum network, but however, everything that
#we learn here can be applied to other blockchains.

# Understanding everything about Ethereum fundamentals will give us the skills that we need to
#switch to other blockchains.

# Keep in mind, there are a couple of smart contracts that do not use solidity, but still learning the
#basics of Ethereum will give us the skills that we need to understand those as well.

# We will also hear theterms Smart Contract Platform and Blockchain Platform used interchangeably.

# Keep in mind that Blockchain means store of value and Smart Contract Platform.

# Similarly, Chainlink is the most Popular and Powerful Decentralized Oracle Network. 

# This is the one we will be mainly using in the course.

# Chainlink is also Blockchain Agnostic, meaning it can be used on any blockchain.

# Recently a new term has been used, and its call Layer 2, or L2.

# Layer 2 is a term used to describe a blockchain that is built on top of another blockchain.

# This solves an issue that most blockchains have, which is scalability.

# The basic concept is that Blockchains can only get so big, so what they do is they create a second 
#layer on top of the original blockchain.

# This is where we get the term Layer 2.

# Right now there are two main Layer 2 solutions, Optimistic Rollups and Zero Knowledge Rollups.

# Optimistic Rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism, or Zero Knowledge Rollups like zkSync and Starknet or 
#Polygon ZK.

# Keep in mind that the Polygon Chain is not the same as Polygon ZK.

# Polygon Chain is a Layer 2 solution, but Polygon ZK is a Zero Knowledge Rollup.

# Another term we will hear throughout the course is Dapp or Decentralized Application.

# Dapp = decentralized application = decentralized protocol = smart contract.

# A Decentralized Application is usually the combination of many smart contracts.

# When we go over solidity, we will see what a singular smart contract really looks like.

# We'll also hear the term Web 3 used a lot.

# Web 3 is the next evolution of the internet.

# Web 1 was the static internet, where we could only read information.

# Web 2 was the dynamic internet, where we could read and write information.

# Web 3 is the decentralized internet, where we can read, write, and own information.

# Web 3 is the internet of value.


#                           What is the value of smart contracts?

# The easiest way to sum up the value is that they create "Trust Minimized Agreements".

# In other words, these agreements create unbreakable promises.

# This gives rise to a new type of economy, the "Trust Minimized Economy", which is built on Speed,
#Efficiency, and Transparency.


#                           What about FTX and Scams?

# FTX and Sam Bankman Fried are a perfect example of the opposite of a trust minimized economy.

# FTX was a centralized exchange, and Sam was a centralized figure.

# This is the opposite of a trust minimized economy.


#                           What have Smart Contracts Done So Far?

# Smart Contracts are responsible for Defi.

# DeFi is short for Decentralized Finance.

# DeFi gives users the ability to engage with finance markets without having to go through a 
#centralized intermediary.

# Next are DAOs.

# DAOs are short for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.

# DAOs are Decentralized Organizations that are run by smart contracts.

# Then there are NFTs.

# NFTs are short for Non Fungible Tokens.

# NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain.
